# Scientific Computing for Chemists with Python

The following is the textbook used for the Scientific Computing Chemists course intended to teach chemists and chemistry students basic computer programming in Python and Jupyter Notebooks and advanced tools for processing, visualization, and analysis of digital data. A chapter outline is provided below. The book starts with a streamlined introduction to Python for chemists followed by introducing powerful computing tools and numerous applications to chemistry. This book assumes that the student or reader has no prior programming experience and has at least one year of undergraduate chemistry background and some very basic spectroscopy/spectrometry (i.e., NMR, IR, UV-vis, and GC/MS) background. All software used (e.g., Python, NumPy, SciPy, etc...) is free and open source software and runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

This book is periodically updated to fix typos, account for new software versions, and add new content. The most recent version can be viewed using the link below or downloaded or forked above along with Jupyter notebooks containing all code in the book. Reports of errors and information on how people are using this book are always welcome.

Answer keys to exercises are available to instructors upon request. Please [email me](https://www.augie.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/chemistry/faculty) using your institutional email address to request a copy.
